			<h3> I am a multimedia journalist specializing in audio and photo. I have a background in local news reporting, national polling reporting, and music reporting. </h3>
		<p class="stories-list-title"> Here are my favorite journalism stories:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5wMPFS9B5V7gg6hZ3UZ7hf" target= "_blank"> Serial Season 1</a> by Sarah Koenig
			 <br/>This was my introduction to investigative audio journalism. I fell in love with the medium though this podcast. I find that this is a great place to spark interest in reporting in those who have never engaged with journalism before.</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/791/transcript" target="_blank"> Math Or Magic?</a> by This American Life
				<br/> This episode of This American Life reframed by vision of what arts and culture reporting can look like. I am very interested in small, maybe mundane stories, that resonate with people and the human experince. </li>
			<li><a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Why_Fish_Don_t_Exist/kkoiEAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=why+fish+don+lulu+miller+website&pg=PA161&printsec=frontcover" target= "_blank"> Why Fish Don't Exist</a> by Lulu Miller
				<br/>This piece of science reporting mixed with personal memoir made me very interested in the world of science journalism and its possibilities. This book is at once a recounting of scientific history and a foundation of a philosophy on life.</li>
